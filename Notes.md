# Build a Portfolio Website With React & Sanity.io

## General Setup

* Installed dependencies, sanity, sanity/client, react-dom-router, etc
* Set up routes
    * put placeholder text in each component to test our react router

### NavBar
* needs NavLink to be imported from react-router-dom
* header > div > nav > NavLink, each navlink is a button
* need to mess around with the styling of my name button, it wasn't lining up with the rest of the navbar like kapehe's
* new div for socials
